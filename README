Description:
	The project's goal is to provides all needed electronic circuits to realize a resistor-key-locker for generic old motorbikes
	or cars where the electrical system is made just by electric wires glued together with tape, usually.
	You can start the engine of these vehicles without key, in easily way. The key-locker has 4 electric wire, one is to disable
	the sparkplugs, an other is to provide electricirty to the car's systems, and the other is to close the engine's starter
	relay. So, a car thief have just to open the first cuple, close the second, and the start wire too. It requires 30 seconds

	With the resistor key-locker, the main electric wires can be not accessible from the panel, for the thief should open the
	car hood or unmount the motorbike to handle the main wires.
	
	Software:
	=========
		All electrical schemas and PCBs have been made using KiCAD-6

	User's guide:
	=============
		The resistor key is a common connector plug (eg. DIB-9) with three resistors linked as shown in the rKey_plug circuit.
		The resistors value are the secret sequence that defines your private key. Only that sequence will allow the main 
		rKey circuit to turn on the motorbike (or car) services, in particular the engine start relay.
		When you will change the key-plug sequence you will need to set again the rKey device. To achive this result you will
		have to connect also the 6 leds monitor rKey_kset device. Then you will have to turn the potentiometers with a
		screwdriver until all led become on.


Devices building:
	About the PCBs creation I have used the MD srl company service. So, in order to create a copy, you can contact the company
	(https://www.mdsrl.it) and use the following order numbers, it will allow you to save some money.
